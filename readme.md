# PSCommenceModules

A collection of Powershell cmdlets for use with Commence RM. Requires [Vovin.CmcLibNet](https://github.com/arnovb-github/CmcLibNet).

This is all in an experimental stage. None of this code is production-ready.

Usage: `using module <path>\PSCommenceModules.dll` (`using` statements must be at the top of a script).

`Get-CmcFieldValues` returns a list of `CommenceField` objects for every database row. Think of it as a table:

| | | | | 
| - | - | - | - | 
| row 0 | CommenceField 0 | CommenceField 1 | ... |
| row 1 | CommenceField 0 | CommenceField 1 | ... |
| row 2 | CommenceField 0 | CommenceField 1 | ... |

A `CommenceField` has these properties: `CategoryName`, `FieldName` and `FieldValue`. 

Example:

```powershell
Get-CmcFieldValues CategoryName FieldName1, FieldName2 | ForEach-Object {
    $_.FieldValue # returns all fieldvalues for all rows
}
```

The complete syntax of `Get-CmcFieldValues` is:

`Get-CmcFieldValues [-CategoryOrViewName] <string> [[-FieldNames] <string[]>] [-UseView] [-UseThids] [-Filters <ICursorFilter[]>] [-RelatedColumns <RelatedColumn[]>] [<CommonParameters>]`

If you specify a Commence viewname instead of a categoryname, use the `-UseView` switch. Note that you still have to specify which fields you want from the view.

If you want THIDs, specify the `-UseThids` switch. You get an additional `CommenceField` object with fieldname 'THID' for every row. Note: this does not work on views.

Providing related columns involves some more work. These are the columns you would set by the `cursor.SetRelatedColumn(â€¦)` method when you program against the Commence API.
You have to explicitly define them:

```powershell
$rc1 = New-Object -TypeName PSCommenceModules.RelatedColumn
$rc1.Connection = 'Relates to' # from the Tutorial database
$rc1.ToCategory = 'Contact' # from the Tutorial database
$rc1.FieldName = 'accountKey' # from the Tutorial database

$rc2 = New-Object -TypeName PSCommenceModules.RelatedColumn
$rc2.Connection = 'Relates to' # from the Tutorial database
$rc2.ToCategory = 'Contact' # from the Tutorial database
$rc2.FieldName = 'emailBusiness' # from the Tutorial database
```

This syntax can be shortened to:
```powershell
$rc1 = [PSCommenceModules.RelatedColumn]::New('Relates to', 'Contact','accountKey')
```

Important: connection names are case-sensitive in Commence!

Usage:
`Get-CmcFieldValues CategoryName FieldName1, FieldName2 -RelatedColumns $rc1, $rc2`

Note: you cannot yet specify only related columns, you need at least 1 direct column (simply ignore it).

You can also supply filters with `-Filters`. For every filtertype there is a cmdlet:

`Get-CmcFilterF [-ClauseNumber] <int> [-FieldName] <string> [-Qualifier] <FilterQualifier> [-FieldValue] <string> [[-FieldValue2] <string>] [-MatchCase] [-Except] [-OrFilter] [<CommonParameters>]`

`Get-CmcFilterCTI [-ClauseNumber] <int> [-Connection] <string> [-Category] <string> [-Item] <string> [-Except] [-OrFilter] [<CommonParameters>]`

`Get-CmcFilterCTCTI [-ClauseNumber] <int> [-Connection] <string> [-Category] <string> [-Connection2] <string> [-Category2] <string> [-Item] <string> [-Except] [-OrFilter] [<CommonParameters>]`

`Get-CmcFilterCTCF [-ClauseNumber] <int> [-Connection] <string> [-Category] <string> [-FieldName] <string> [-Qualifier] <FilterQualifier> [-FieldValue] <string> [[-FieldValue2] <string>] [-MatchCase] [-Except] [-OrFilter] [<CommonParameters>]`

So getting a Field filter could be:

```powershell
$filter = Get-CmcFilterF 1 Name 0 test -Except -MatchCase -Verbose
```

For brevity I used the `int` value 0 for the filterqualifier. In the real world you should use its constant value, in this case `[Vovin.CmcLibNet.Database.FilterQualifier]::Contains`.

Important: you specify the filter conjunction in the filter. It defaults to `AND`, specify `-OrFilter` for `OR`. This is different from how you do it in Commence.

The `Get-CmcFilter*` cmcdlets are just for convenience. They do **not** check for correctness of the parameters, but there is a cmdlet to try out filters. 

`Resolve-CmcFilter [-Category] <string> [-Filter] <ICursorFilter> [<CommonParameters>]`

This will tell you if the filter *technically* works on the specified category (as in: Commence accepts this filter as valid, regardless of results). Using this cmdlet in a production environment is not recommended, because it is very resource-expensive.

There is also the `Get-CmcFieldValue` cmdlet for getting just a single field. It is like the singular, baby brother of `Get-CmcFieldValues`. It only supports direct fields, and does not support filtering. It does support using views, so you can do any filtering in Commence. You can use it if you are only interested in a single field.

`Get-CmcFieldValue [-CategoryOrViewName] <string> [[-FieldName] <string>] [-UseView] [<CommonParameters>]`
