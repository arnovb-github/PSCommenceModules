# PSCommenceModules

A collection of Powershell cmdlets for use with Commence RM. Requires [Vovin.CmcLibNet](https://github.com/arnovb-github/CmcLibNet).

This is all in an experimental stage. None of this code is production-ready.

Usage: `using module <path>\PSCommenceModules.dll`

Note that `Import-Module` may not work, because the assembly exposes classes.
