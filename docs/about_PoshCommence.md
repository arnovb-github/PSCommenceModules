## about_PoshCommence

# SHORT DESCRIPTION
PowerShell cmdlets for Commence RM.


# LONG DESCRIPTION
PoshCommence contains cmdlets that you can use in conjunction with the
Commence RM Designer Edition database application. It is a set of
convenience cmdlets based on the 
[Vovin.CmcLibNet](https://github.com/arnovb-github/CmcLibNet) library.

Importing the `PoshCommence` module will automatically bring in the 
`Vovin.CmcLibNet` assembly.

# NOTE
Vovin.CmcLibNet is a .Net wrapper for the Commence RM API. It was designed to work with a single active Commence database. The cmdlets in PoshCommence therefore (almost) all expect that a single instance of Commence RM is running.

# TROUBLESHOOTING NOTE
All of this is experimental.
